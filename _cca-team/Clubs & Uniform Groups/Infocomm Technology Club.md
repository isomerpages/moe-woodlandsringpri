Overview:
---------

WRPS InfoComm Club offers students an exciting 3-year journey into Digital Media. We aim to equip students with additional ICT skills at different levels. The skills include digital photography and photo editing, movie-making, website creation and coding. Utilising the resources available in the ICT Department, students will have hands-on sessions using the DSLR cameras, Adobe Photoshop and Movie Maker software and online software for coding and website creation.

  

Students will get to take part in various competitions that are held island-wide. Students will get to interact with students from other schools as they represent the school for competitions, and pick up new skills along the way.

  

CCA sessions in InfoComm will never be a bore!
