<h1>Scouts</h1>
<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>The Cub Scouts CCA is open for boys and girls. The objective of the CCA
is to provide a group environment which is engaging and work towards developing
Cub Scouts holistically. Besides inculcating Cub Scouts with our school’s
core values of integrity, respect, resilience, responsibility, and care,
they will also learn to lead and work as a team with others.</p>
<p>The CCA activities are largely conducted through games, interaction in
small groups and activities. Cub Scouts will also have the opportunity
to engage in community services and participate in camps to interact with
Cub Scouts and Service Scouts from different schools.</p>
<p>Throughout their time in the CCA, Cub Scouts will earn a series of Badges,
giving them basic knowledge of first-aid and scouting skills –knotting,
navigation etc. The Cub Scouts Training Scheme is divided into 3 progress
badges (Bronze Arrow, Silver Arrow, Gold Arrow) and a highest award (Akela
Award). Each progress badge focuses on key areas such as Citizenship, Leadership
and Responsibility, Physical Skills, Self-Reliance, Adventure and Fun.</p>
<p>At Woodlands Ring Primary School, we hope that our Cub Scouts will grow
and develop into leaders with heart and character.</p>
