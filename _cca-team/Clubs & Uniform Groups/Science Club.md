<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>The Science Club allows members to embark on an inquiry-based journey
both in everyday Science around them as well as to develop a sense of appreciation
for the environment around them and actively make consistent efforts towards
sustainability. It serves to instill both scientific knowledge and environmental
awareness in school and community. The members are the key drivers fostering
sustainable environmental habits in our school community. The Science club
also provides platforms for the pupils to experience first-hand, the process
of discovering and exploring new knowledge through hands-on Science experiments,
and participating in Science competitions and environment-related projects.
They also assist the school in investigating data needed to help the school
community to be a greener school, conducive to learning while promoting
environmental and sustainability literacy. Through current issues, learning
journeys and scientific experiments, students will learn social and life
skills.</p>
