Overview:
---------

The Science Club allows members to embark on an inquiry-based journey both in everyday Science around them as well as to develop a sense of appreciation for the environment around them and actively make consistent efforts towards sustainability. It serves to instill both scientific knowledge and environmental awareness in school and community. The members are the key drivers fostering sustainable environmental habits in our school community. The Science club also provides platforms for the pupils to experience first-hand, the process of discovering and exploring new knowledge through hands-on Science experiments, and participating in Science competitions and environment-related projects. They also assist the school in investigating data needed to help the school community to be a greener school, conducive to learning while promoting environmental and sustainability literacy. Through current issues, learning journeys and scientific experiments, students will learn social and life skills.
