Basketball
==========

Overview:
---------

Our Basketball CCA was started in 2016. Known as the WRPS Eagles, our Basketball boys and girls not only learn about fundamental basketball skills and physical conditioning, but also values like sportsmanship, resilience and teamwork.

  

Selected students are invited to join in P3. Pupils who show potential in the sport will be identified for school team selection training. The selected students will have the opportunity to represent our school in various competitions.
