Overview:
---------
Since its inception in 2016, the WRPS Basketball CCA has been&nbsp;going from strength to strength. Known as the WRPS Eagles, our&nbsp;Basketball boys and girls not only learn fundamental basketball&nbsp;skills and improve on physical conditioning, but also demonstrate&nbsp;values like sportsmanship, resilience and teamwork.&nbsp;Besides welcoming all interested students to join the WRPS&nbsp;Basketball CCA, those who show strong potential in the sport and&nbsp;an affinity for teamwork will be selected to represent the school in&nbsp;various competitions, such as the National School Games.
