The Football CCA is one of the popular CCAs in WRPS. Each year, we receive many applications from students who are eager to join. The CCA aims to develop our members not only physically but holistically as well. Our members will get the opportunity to discover their own unique talents as well as hone their personal set of skills. The Football CCA will help add value to these members and ensure their development throughout their primary school life.
