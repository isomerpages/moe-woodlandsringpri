Floorball
-------------
Floorball is a team possession/invasion game played between two teams of players, each using a plastic manipulative (stick) to drive an air flow ball towards the opponent’s goal in an indoor court. Floorball has seen a rise in popularity among youths in the last decade, with our Singapore Teams clinching the gold medals in the SEA Games. It is an intensive and competitive sport CCA which helps develop physical fitness, self-discipline, resilience and teamwork. Our Floorball players go through a comprehensive training programme that not only develops and hones the technical skills such as dribbling, passing and tackling, but also tactical concepts of attack and defence. Floorball is offered to both boys and girls to play at a recreational level.
