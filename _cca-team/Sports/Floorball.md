<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Floorball&nbsp;is a&nbsp;team possession/invasion game played between
two teams of players, each using a plastic manipulative (stick) to drive
an air flow ball towards the opponent’s goal in an indoor court. Floorball
has seen a rise in popularity among youths in the last decade, with our
Singapore Teams clinching the gold medals in the SEA Games. It is an intensive
and competitive sport CCA which helps develop physical fitness, self-discipline,
resilience and teamwork. Our Floorball players go through a comprehensive
training programme that not only develops and hones the technical skills
such as dribbling, passing and tackling, but also tactical concepts of
attack and defence. Floorball is offered to both boys and girls to play
at a recreational level.</p>
