Overview:
---------

Chinese Dance is one of the popular performing arts groups in WRPS. It allows students to artistically express themselves with their limbs and body. The dances cover a wide range, from folk dances to contemporary dance performances. Chinese dance is performed mainly in public celebrations, rituals and ceremonies. Through dancing on stage, students learn how to express feelings with grace and finesse. Apart from performing in school events, students are also given the platform to perform at the bi-annual Singapore Youth Festival held nationwide. The Chinese dancers also have the opportunity to showcase their dance moves through performances outside school, like the National Day Celebration held by Woodlands Community Centre, Youth Festival School Dance Showcase at Gardens by the Bay.
