Overview:
---------

Chinese Dance consists of many modern and traditional dance genres. The dances cover a wide range, from folk dances to performances in opera and ballet, and may be used in public celebrations, rituals and ceremonies. The best known Chinese dances today are the Dragon dance and the Lion Dance.

Currently, the Chinese dancers in our school perform at various school events like Chinese New Year Concert, National Day Celebration and other major school events etc. They also participate in the Central SYF Judging held every two years. The Chinese dancers also have the opportunity to showcase their dance moves through performances outside school, like the Woodlands Community Chinese New Year Celebration etc.
