## Grace in Motion, Grace in Tradition

At Woodlands Ring Primary School, our Malay Dance CCA is a celebration of tradition, culture, and expression. Through the beauty of dance, our students develop grace, confidence, and a deep appreciation for the rich heritage of the Malay community. More than just movement, Malay dance nurtures discipline, teamwork, and self-expression, shaping our dancers into well-rounded individuals.



## Our Values: RASA
