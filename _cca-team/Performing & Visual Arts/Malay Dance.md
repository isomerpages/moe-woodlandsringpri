Overview:
---------

Malay Dance CCA provides a platform for dancers to develop their Malay dance skills. It is an avenue for students to build their confidence on stage by performing the different dance forms. Apart from grooming our young talents, the Malay Dance CCA also aims to instil in our students good values and character through our training sessions and cultural immersion programmes and performance platforms.
