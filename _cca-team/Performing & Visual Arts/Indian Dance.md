Overview:
---------

Indian Dance provides a platform for students to learn and appreciate the fine aesthetics of Indian dance under the guidance of the CCA teachers and an experienced instructor. They are exposed to various Indian dance genres and forms such as Bharathanatyam, Indian folk and contemporary dance. Students learn intricate footwork and hand-leg coordination skills that are quintessential to the Indian dance Art form.

  

Through dance, the students cultivate resilience, grace and a sense of teamwork that extend beyond the classroom and nurture their growth as individuals. Various platforms such as external performances at community events and SYF Arts Presentations help to build the confidence of the students and showcase their talents.
