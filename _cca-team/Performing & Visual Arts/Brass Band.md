Overview:
---------

In Brass Band, students hone their instrument-playing skills with ample guidance by seniors, instructors and teachers. Not only do pupils learn to play instruments in an ensemble setting, they also learn to be disciplined and responsible for their own learning and instruments. Students also practise our school core values such as resilience, putting in effort to improve their playing skills, and care by guiding and learning from one another during practice sessions. While learning to play in unison, teamwork is everything. The Band members share fun, laughter and love for music; they reflect on how they can do better by tapping on one another’s strengths.

  

The WRPS Brass Band has had the opportunity to perform at various school events such as Chinese New Year Concerts, National Day Concerts, Woodlands Ring Primary 20th Anniversary Carnival as well as public events such as the Community Outreach @ Kampung Admiralty. These opportunities have definitely shaped and prepared the band for the biennial SYF Arts Presentations showcases.
