Overview:
---------

The Hip Hop dancers of Woodlands Ring Primary School **_#WRPSTeamRingEagles_** are trained in different genres of hip-hop dances. Our dancers use body movement and rhythm of music to express their emotions, individuality and personal style. They also learn an appreciation of the different elements in Hip Hop dance culture, and showcase any dance items with confidence.

  

Our experienced and passionate instructors and teachers hope to inspire the love of dance in every member of our CCA. We believe that everyone can communicate and express themselves through dance.

  

If you think you have good rhythm, timing, concentration and most importantly, determination to work hard, then you are definitely what we are looking for! Come and join us!
