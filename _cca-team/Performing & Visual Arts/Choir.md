Overview:
---------

Choir is one of the longest-serving performance clubs in Woodlands Ring Primary School. Choir members are not only equipped with vocal techniques, but are also exposed to music theories. Under the guidance of our experienced and knowledgeable instructors and teachers, choir members enjoy singing a repertoire of songs in different languages that are often showcased in school and local events as well as in competitions. As we aim to develop our members holistically, opportunities are created to hone leadership and mentoring skills whilst fostering friendship through our activities. If you have passion for singing, unleash the musical talent in you. You are the one we are looking for! Come and join us!

  

_“The only thing better than singing is more singing.” – Ella Fitzgerald_
