### CCA POLICY
----------
At WRPS, our Primary 3 to Primary 6 students are strongly encouraged to take part in one CCA. However, students who are already very active in a school-recognised sport / game outside school and training competitively may be excused. 

  

P3 students are given 4 choices during annual CCA Application Exercise in Term 2. Upon being assigned to one of the CCAs chosen by the students in consultation with the parents, students are strongly advised to remain in the same CCA for the complete school year so that students are able to acquire and develop a strong set of CCA-specific knowledge and aptitude before graduating from WRPS.

  

Attendance is compulsory at every CCA session. A medical certificate or a letter from the parent is necessary if the student is absent.
