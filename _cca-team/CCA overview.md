CCA

CCA POLICY
----------

At WRPS, our Primary 3 to Primary 6 students are strongly encouraged to take part in one CCA. However, students who are already very active in a school-recognised sport / game outside school and training competitively may be excused. A letter from the club / association is to be handed to the HOD PE/CCA for verification purposes and students will have to submit their attendance at the end of every month.

  

Upon being assigned a CCA, students are strongly advised to remain in the same CCA for the complete school year. To ensure that students acquire and develop a strong set of CCA-specific knowledge and aptitude before graduating from WRPS.

  

Attendance is compulsory at every CCA session. A medical certificate or a letter from the parent is necessary if the student is absent.
