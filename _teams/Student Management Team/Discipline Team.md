Spot Checks
-----------

Spot checks are carried out every term to ensure that pupils are properly attired and that their hair-style is acceptable.

Most Well-behaved and Most Improved in Behaviour
------------------------------------------------

**Rationale**

1\. To recognize pupils who exhibits exemplary behavior and are role models to their classmates

2\. To recognize pupils who made a conscious effort to change in their behavior or attitude in their studies.

  

Every term, two pupils from each class are nominated by their classmates and teacher to receive these two awards.

  

Pupils who have been nominated will receive a certificate with remarks written by their form teacher on the qualities that were portrayed and observed.

Catch Me Doing Right
--------------------

**Rationale:** To promote good values in everyone, in and outside the school

  

Every time a pupil is "caught" doing right, he or she receives a sticker from a staff in the school which is to be pasted in the pupils’ planner. The school would like to see pupils displaying the following positive behaviours in and outside school.

  

**Examples of good deeds:-**

*   Patient and caring
*   Responsible such as picking up litter without being told
*   Helping someone
*   Courteous e.g. Saying 'thank you', 'please'
*   Encouraging or reminding others to behave or do the right thing
*   Behaving when the teacher is not around

  

**Reward**

Stickers will be exchanged for various types of tokens according to the number of stickers they have every Term
