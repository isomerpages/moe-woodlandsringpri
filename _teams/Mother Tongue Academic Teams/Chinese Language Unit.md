there was a video montage of teachers and students sending their well wishes
to everyone. Following that, students had their snack break while enjoying
Chinese New Year songs. Various CCAs also participated in the celebration
and showcased their talents through different performances. Pupils were
given the opportunity to record their performances from home and there
