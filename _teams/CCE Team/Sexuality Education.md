Sexuality Education
===================

KEY MESSAGES 
----------------------------------

The key messages for students to understand are as follows: a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others; b) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families); c) Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family, and the society; and d) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unwanted pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.
