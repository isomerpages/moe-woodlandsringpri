National Education
===========

  National Education (NE) was launched in 1997. It aims to provide our students with the knowledge, skills, and values to understand Singapore’s history and unique geo-political context, appreciate our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation, and have confidence in our nation’s future.

NE provides opportunities for our students to explore and examine their identity as Singaporeans and arrive at a common set of ideals and values. The following key dispositions for citizenship in Singapore shape the purpose and approach to NE:




National Education Messages
---------------------------

At WRPS, we aim to develop a sense of loyalty and rootedness to Singapore in our pupils by instilling in them the six key National Education messages.

  

1.  **Singapore is our homeland; this is where we belong.**

_We treasure our heritage and take pride in shaping our own unique way of life._

  

2.  **We must preserve racial and religious harmony.**

_We value our diversity and are determined to stay a united people._

  

3.  **We must uphold meritocracy and incorruptibility.**

_We provide opportunities for all, according to their ability and effort._

  

4.  **No one owes Singapore a living.**

_We find our own way to survive and prosper, turning challenge into opportunity._

  

5.  **We must ourselves defend Singapore.**

_We are proud to defend Singapore ourselves, no one else is responsible for our security and well-being._

  

6.  **We have confidence in our future.**

_United, determined and well-prepared, we have what it takes to build a bright future for ourselves, and to progress together as one nation_
