Character & Citizenship Education Team
--------------------------------------

Woodlands Ring Primary School’s vision of Passionate Learners, Gracious Citizen’ stems from its belief that Character and Citizenship development is one of the key factors towards the holistic development of its pupils. It is centered on the WRPS core values which we hope to inculcate in the pupils to equip them to be citizens of good character. These values are driven by Social Emotional Competencies - skills necessary for children to recognize and manage their emotions, develop care and concern for others, make responsible decisions and establish positive relationships.
