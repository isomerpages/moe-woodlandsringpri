Values in Action (ViA)
======================

In WRPS we would like to develop our pupils to be Passionate Learners and Gracious Citizens through the different VIA learning experiences. It is a learning experience in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) that enhances pupilsâ€™ development as socially responsible citizens through ownership of their contribution to the community.

Activities

| **P2 - Water Conservation Programme & Home-based VIA** 	| **P4 - Project Buddy Clean & Keep Clean Programme** 	| **P6 - Keep Clean Programme** 	|

  

Pupils learn a range of valuable practical skills including problem solving, organizing, collaborating, project

management, research, dealing with obstacles and setbacks, etc. Relationships are formed through the

activities with the people around them in a meaningful and respectful manner.

  

Being actively involved in learning about and appreciating the community develops their sense of commitment

in playing their part to make it a better place. When pupils apply what they learn, they make responsible choices

and become informed and concerned citizens of good character.
