<h1>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</h1>
<p>PAL is one of the major recommendations aimed at providing greater balance
between the learning of knowledge and the development of skills and values
to better prepare our children to thrive in a fast-changing and globalised
future. It encourages the well-rounded development of pupils in the five
learning domains (i.e. Cognitive, Aesthetics, Moral, physical and social)
and provides varied avenues for pupils to develop social and emotional
competencies.</p>
<p>The modules of activities are as follows:</p>
