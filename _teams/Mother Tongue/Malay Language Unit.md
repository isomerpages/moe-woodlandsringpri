<h1>Malay Language Unit</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In line with the unit's mission, teachers in the Malay Language department
always strive to inculcate passion for the Malay heritage and culture in
our pupils while nurturing them to become effective and confident communicators
of their Mother Tongue language. When the love of one's heritage and culture
has been ignited, pupils would intrinsically be interested to learn more
about their Mother Tongue language.</p>
<p>Together we work towards our mission with the belief that each individual
child is unique. The department provides multi-modal learning platforms
with different teaching pedagogies such as Cooperative Learning and Multi-Intelligences.</p>
<p>Programmes such as our annual Composition Clinic, Comprehension Clinic
and Cultural Camp provide a learning platform to foster pupils' learning
and interest thus making Malay Language acquisition appealing and more
enjoyable.</p>

Pupils who have opted for the course will attend 10 lessons. The lessons
(2 hours per lesson) are held outside curriculum time on a weekly basis.
The program aims to teach our pupils simple, conversational phrases in
other Mother Tongue Language, besides their own. While keeping our mother
tongues and cultures alive, acquiring other languages will enable us to
link up with opportunities beyond Singapore such as those in Southeast
Asia and the Middle-East.
