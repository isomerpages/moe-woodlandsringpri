<h2>Chinese New Year Celebration</h2>
<p>Woodlands Ring Primary School celebrated Chinese New Year this year with
pre-recorded performances shown in their classrooms on 31st January 2022.
The concert started off with an interesting lion dance performance. Next,
there was a video montage of teachers and students sending their well wishes
to everyone. Following that, students had their snack break while enjoying
Chinese New Year songs. Various CCAs also participated in the celebration
and showcased their talents through different performances. Pupils were
given the opportunity to record their performances from home and there
was even a classroom visit by “God of Fortune” while the celebration was
going on! After viewing the performances, the pupils got to learn more
about Chinese New Year traditions and customs through a presentation and
ended the day by engaging in fun-filled classroom activities led by their
form teachers.</p>
