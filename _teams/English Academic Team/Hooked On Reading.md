To develop a school-wide reading culture and getting pupils hooked on books, we have organised a series of activities to engage our pupils in reading. Besides the school library which will be an interactive hub promoting joyful reading through storytelling sessions and thematic book displays, there are also fortnightly reading periods promoting different book genres and an uninterrupted reading time. Pupils set their reading goals and reflect on the books that they have read through book reflections and reading extension activities. Just like Walt Disney famously said, **“There is more treasure in books than in all the pirates’ loot on Treasure Island.”**
