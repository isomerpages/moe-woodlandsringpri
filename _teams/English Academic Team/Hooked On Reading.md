Hooked On Reading

To develop a school-wide reading culture and getting pupils hooked on books, we have organised a series of activities to engage our pupils in reading. Besides the school library which will be an interactive hub promoting joyful reading through storytelling sessions and thematic book displays, there are also fortnightly reading periods promoting different book genres and an uninterrupted reading time. Pupils set their reading goals and reflect on the books that they have read through book reflections and reading extension activities. Just like Walt Disney famously said, **“There is more treasure in books than in all the pirates’ loot on Treasure Island.”**

#### CATCH ME READING

  

Look who’s hooked on a book! To promote reading as a lifestyle, our school has recently launched an incentive programme to encourage pupils to read enthusiastically during their free pockets of time. Pupils caught reading outside the classrooms and library were featured prominently on display boards and given stickers which can be exchanged for gifts at the end of the semester. This form of extrinsic motivation, along with a host of reading events lined up for the year, will raise our pupils to become eager readers for life. So hurry, let’s get caught reading!

#### INTENSIVE READING PROGRAMME

  

The main goal of this programme is for pupils to understand the texts read at a deeper level. At the P1 and P2 level, all pupils subscribe to the National Geographic Magazine and teachers would select articles to discuss with the pupils. At the P3 level, they are involved in Spin-a-Tale Programme where every child is given a copy of a twisted tale for them to read and understand the point of view of the different characters. At P3, pupils also subscribe to the Storytime magazine where stories are shared to encourage them to read widely and read for pleasure. To expose our pupils to current affairs, pupils subscribe to Whiz Magazine at P4 and What’s Up Newspaper at P5 and P6 levels. Again as a level, selected articles would be highlighted for explicit teaching.
