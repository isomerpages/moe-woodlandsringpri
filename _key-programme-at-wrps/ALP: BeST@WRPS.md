ALP: Be.S.T.@WRPS
=================

Woodlands Ring Primary School is offering STEM Applied Learning Programme, **“Be.S.T”** (Be a Design Thinker).

  

**Be.S.T @ WRPS** is designed with purposeful learning experiences for our students in Game Design and Making according to environmental themes. Upper Primary students will tap on knowledge and skills learnt in the coding programme and will learn the considerations, and elements of game design by tinkering and making their own games. Through this ALP, students will be curious and creative problem solvers who have adaptive and “dare to fail” mindsets.

These are some interesting board games created by the students. The one on the left was very interesting. It was a vending machine game.

The students were so engaged in this game making and design that they brought down their board games and played during recess.
