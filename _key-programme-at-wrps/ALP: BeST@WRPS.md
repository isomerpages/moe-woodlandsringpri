ALP: Be.S.T.@WRPS
=================

Woodlands Ring Primary School is offering STEM Applied Learning Programme, **“Be.S.T”** (Be a Design Thinker).

  

**Be.S.T @ WRPS** is designed with purposeful learning experiences for our students in Game Design and Making according to environmental themes. Upper Primary students will tap on knowledge and skills learnt in the coding programme and will learn the considerations, and elements of game design by tinkering and making their own games. Through this ALP, students will be curious and creative problem solvers who have adaptive and “dare to fail” mindsets.
