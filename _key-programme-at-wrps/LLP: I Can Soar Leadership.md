<h1>Student Leadership</h1>
<p>In Woodlands Ring Primary school, we tap on Student Leadership which is
our LLP to deepen learning, develop leadership and promote student initiation.
This is aligned to our school’s strategic thrust of Fostering Strength
in Leadership and Character. The Student Leadership Development focuses
on providing training for all students with the basic leadership skills
and school values.</p>
<p>In line with our school’s symbolic imagery of a soaring eagle, we believe
that nurturing students with a strong moral anchor, equipping them with
leadership skills and 21st century competencies will help them soar in
a VUCA world. Through various platforms and a common language anchored
on The Leadership Challenge, it would further deepen learning and promote
shared understanding in the WRPS community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the LLP framework, we have highlighted our structured and progressive
approaches to achieve our 3 key LLP outcomes:</p>

<p>Through the inception of LLP, we aim to further deepen our students’ learning
by adopting Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory anchored on the 5 practices
of the Leadership Challenge Model as a guide to craft our learning experiences
with a strong emphasis on student-initiation and deep reflection.</p>

<p><strong>WRPS Student Leaders Structure</strong>

action and internalization of prosocial behaviours.</p>
<p>To realize our students' leadership potential, the <strong>IDEA</strong> talent
management approach (Tier 2) seeks to <strong>I</strong>dentify potential
leaders, <strong>D</strong>evelop their leadership competencies, provide
platforms for <strong>E</strong>xposure, <strong>A</strong>ssess students’
leadership growth at critical junctures and Acknowledge their contributions
to the school and community.</p>
