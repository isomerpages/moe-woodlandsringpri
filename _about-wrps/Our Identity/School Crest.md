School Crest
============
<img src="/images/crest.gif" style="width:50%">
The colours, white, blue and green reflect honesty, harmony and vitality respectively.

  

The eagle, representing strength, confidence and swiftness in action, reflects the importance of taking pride in our work and our ability to soar to new heights.

  

The three trees, formed by the stylish representation of the letter 'w' and 'r' standing for Woodlands Ring Primary School., illustrate creativity. They signify growth and the close collaboration of teachers, pupils and parents in moulding the future of our nation.

  

The horizon symbolises vision, looking ahead towards a bright future while the open book and the ring represent the desire to be learners for life and an all rounded education respectively.

  

The name of the school is inscribed in the ring above the school motto:  
**'We Do Our Best'.**
