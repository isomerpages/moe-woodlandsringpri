WRPS School Song
----------------
It all begins at Woodlands Ring   
A thinking school that guides within   
Learning nation we will be  
Standing Strong and creative

  

At Woodlands Ring we do our best   
Whatever be the test   
With one voice, we sing of our love   
For nation and Woodlands Ring

  

We learn to tell what's right and wrong   
Making friends and building bonds  
We will proudly soar with  
One vision, one heart, one mind

  

At Woodlands Ring we do our best   
Whatever be the test   
With one voice, we sing of our love  
For nation and Woodlands Ring
