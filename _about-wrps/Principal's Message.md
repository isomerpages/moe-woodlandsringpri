Principal's Message
===================
![](/images/msgeetha.png)


Welcome to our school website which showcases life and learning in Woodlands Ring Primary School. Which is seen as a vibrant hub of learning at the heart of the Woodlands community. As the principal of the school, I feel honored and privileged to be part of an educational institution where every student, staff member and partner in education subscribes to the simple yet compelling school motto “We do our best”.

Here we believe every student is a unique individual with special gifts and talents. With the right motivation, support and hard work, all students will discover their talents and flourish.

Our students are at the heart of all that we do and we are committed to the development of the whole child. While our pupils need to be equipped with knowledge and skills, dispositions and competencies relevant for the 21st century, it is imperative that they are grounded in sound values that guide them to make the right choices. Our school Vision “Passionate Learners and Gracious Citizens” reflects the outcomes we aim for as we design the suite of educational experiences for our diverse learners.

As a community of dedicated educators and professionals, we in Woodlands Ring Primary School continuously strive to provide a caring and stimulating learning environment to bring out the best in every child.
