The Ministry of Education provides financial assistance to needy Singapore Citizen students in Government or Government-aided schools so that all Singaporeans, regardless of their financial background, can benefit from the best opportunities in education. It also provides subsidy for school fees to Singapore Citizen students from lower and middle-income families in Independent Schools, except Singapore Sports School, Northlight School, Assumption Pathway School and School Of The Arts which have their own financial assistance schemes.

  
### ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR MOE FAS
